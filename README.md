# vscode-easy-shortcuts README

This extension simply adds a faster way to access some of the shortcuts in VS Code.  All of the shortcuts below can be toggled individually via the settings.

NOTE: Shortcuts are limited to the same functionality as when you press the keyboard combination, meaning there isn't additional functionality, only faster access to it!
